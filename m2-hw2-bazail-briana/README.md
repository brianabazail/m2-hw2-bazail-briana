# m2-hw2-bazail-briana

I had no issues throughout the assignment until I had to push my commits to the remote repo. I keep getting the following error:

remote: Permission to brianabazail/m2-h2-bazail-briana.git denied to brianasbazail.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/brianabazail/m2-hw2-bazailbriana.git/': the requested URL returned error: 403

I recently found out I have 2 GitHub accounts and I think this might be causing the issue. One account is 'brianabazail' and the other is 'brianasbazail'. I think my terminal might be connected to brianasbazail and is not allowing my to push commits to this account. Is there a way to switch accounts and delete one so that I don't run into this issue anymore? 

I will attach screenshots of the errors I received to this repo and all the commits I logged since it is not showing up here. Sorry about this ):
